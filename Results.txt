With Tesseract:
    - Character Recognition
        Example6.jpg
        Recognizes characters properly and places boxes around them. Places boxes around the UI buttons but is fine.
        
        Example7.jpg
        Recognizes some of the characters and places box around entire image, testing out improvements by putting 
        greater focus on characters.

        Example7_2.jpg
        Recognizes even less, still places box around entire image window instead of just the specific characters.
